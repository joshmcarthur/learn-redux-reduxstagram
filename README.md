# Reduxstagram

My final implementation of Wes Bos' [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) course, but slightly modified
to use create-react-app, not a custom webpack implementation.

I was hoping to upgrade things to work with the latest versions of React, Redux, and React Router, however it looks
like a new version of React Router and Redux Router is waiting in the wings as a beta, so decided to hold off - this
results in react, redux and react-router all being held at older versions.
